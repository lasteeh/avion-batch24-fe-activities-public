          <h2 class="section-title">The Bob Ross Story</h2>
          <article>
            <h3>Early On</h3>
            <p>
              Robert Norman Ross was born in Daytona, Florida, on October 29,
              1942 to Jack and Ollie Ross. From his mother Bob learned a love
              and respect of wildlife. Bob's father was a carpenter and for a
              short time Bob worked with him but after an unfortunate accident
              where Bob cut off one of his fingers he decided that carpentry
              wasn't for him and in 1960 he joined the Air Force.

            <h3>Learning to Paint</h3>
            <p>
              Stationed first in Florida he was eventually transferred to an
              airbase in Alaska. During his service there Bob took his first
              painting lesson at a U.S.O. Club in Anchorage. To augment his Air
              Force pay Bob took a job as a bartender and sold his landscape
              paintings on gold prospecting pans to tourists. When he left the
              Air Force and returned home to Florida Bob attended various art
              schools and painting classes until he discovered the “wet-on-wet”
              painting technique being taught by William Alexander. Bob
              continued to experiment and refine the wet-on-wet technique
              ultimately creating his own unique version along with the custom
              made paints, brushes and knives need to follow it. The Bob Ross
              wet-on-wet technique is also known as “alla prima” or “direct
              painting”. Work created using the “alla prima” technique can be
              completed in a single session. From the 16th century until
              todayThroughout art history from the 16th century until today
              artists such as Jan van Eyck, Diego Velázquez and Thomas
              Gainsborough as well as impressionists Claude Monet, and Vincent
              van Gogh, realists John Singer Sargent and even modern artists
              like Willem de Kooning have, in different ways, employed the alla
              prima technique.

            <h3>Teaching Others to Paint</h3>
            <p>
              Bob was passionate about sharing his love for painting with the
              world and in 1982 along with his partners he launched the Joy of
              Painting on public television. To promote the television show and
              reach a greater audience Bob toured America teaching others to
              paint. In the beginning, the classes that were offered in shopping
              malls and art stores yielded only small groups of students. As
              word of the popular TV show grew so did the live audiences for his
              public lessons. From 1982 through 1994, Bob recorded more than 400
              episodes and the The Joy of Painting became and remains today, one
              of the most popular and well known shows on public television.
              Bob's passion for teaching and inspiring others lives on today
              through the thousands of instructors who teach his method around
              the world.

            <h3>A Media Darling</h3>
            <p>
              Although he might seem shy and retiring Bob was a savvy media
              personality. He often reached out to his viewers for ideas and
              shared their successes with his audience. He was regularly asked
              to appear on talk shows where he entranced the live studio
              audiences. He famously recorded a promo for MTV when the network
              was still young and growing.

            <h3>Something For Everyone</h3>
            <p>
              Dedicated fans include Baby Boomers, Millennials, and Generation
              Zs alike who enjoy and appreciate the happy little trees, friendly
              clouds and happy accidents that can make the noise and whirlwind
              of their everyday lives a little easier to take in. There is also
              some science behind the dulcet tones of Bob's voice and the gentle
              tap-tap-tapping of the two inch brush. For many fans Bob is the
              “King of ASMR” the audio sensory meridian response that keeps
              people tuned in and watching his every move. He can can also be
              found today at the forefront of an exciting and inspirational
              wellness movement.

            <h3>And The Beat Goes On</h3>
            <p>
              His presence continues today with the thousands of tributes and
              parodies that can be found across the internet. From the
              Twittersphere to YouTube to professional sports teams, there are
              no barriers to fan appreciation. Bob appeals to everyone. When the
              interactive gamer platform Twitch launched the Bob Ross channel
              with a nonstop marathon of the Joy of Painting, there were 5.6
              million unique views and thousands of requests for more when the
              series ended. Yes, you can see the “Real McCoy”Few painters have
              been copied as much as Bob and copycat versions of his artworks
              abound. Although he donated many of his works to public television
              stations to help them with fundraising, you can still see a
              painting from the show. The best place to see an original is to
              visit the Bob Ross Workshop in New Smyrna Beach, Florida where
              you'll find a large collection of original paintings Classes in
              the Bob Ross method of painting are offered there and you can also
              train to become a certified Bob Ross instructor in landscape,
              florals, and wildlife painting.
